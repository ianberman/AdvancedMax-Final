# In The Style Of... (2019)

Real-time machine learning-powered audio classification and analysis/resynthesis using IRCAM’s MuBu.
Max/MSP software developed in Dafna Naphtali’s graduate-level computer music course.

Open an example video to see it in action! See the main patch for a detailed readme.

Requires IRCAM's MuBu. I recommend using Loopback or Soundflower etc. for ease of realtime audio classification but it's not necessary.

To-Do: implement a normalization preprocessing algorithm, which will substantially improve the algorithm's performance.
