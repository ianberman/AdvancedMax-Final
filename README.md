# In The Style Of... (2019)

Real-time machine learning-powered audio classification and analysis/resynthesis using IRCAM’s MuBu.
Max/MSP software developed in Dafna Naphtali’s graduate-level computer music course.

Open an example video to see it in action!

Requires IRCAM's MuBu. I recommend using Loopback or Soundflower etc. for ease of realtime audio classification but it's not necessary. See the main patch for a detailed readme. Comments, questions, feedback: twitter- @speculativename

To start, open main_9-24.maxpat in Max 8.

To-Do: <s> implement a normalization preprocessing algorithm, which will substantially improve the algorithm's performance. </s>
       - conduct research on best classification descriptors (ongoing)
